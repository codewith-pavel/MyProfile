### 🧬 Current Research Focus

I'm currently exploring:

- **Bilingual Clinical NLP**: Translating clinical texts from English to Bengali and predicting outcomes such as **mortality** and **length of stay** using transformer-based architectures like **BanglaBERT**.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Designing **multi-exit teacher models** and **hybrid student networks** (CNN + EfficientNetB0) to reduce model size while maintaining performance.
- **Vision + Language**: Combining **Siamese Networks** with **image-text embeddings** for medical verification and **multimodal understanding**.
